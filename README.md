Demistify and open up the Kenyan coffee market through data for the benefit of smallholder farmers, buyers, consumers and traders: Kenya Coffee Grades, Kenya Coffee Directory, Kenya Coffee Growing regions. The goal of this repository is to build a rich dataset to make it easy to identiy Kenyan coffee and to get to the point where we can have equivalents of champagne, gruyere, and emmental to improve the livelihoods of farmers, their lands and their communities.
